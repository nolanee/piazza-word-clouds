Content:The little things matter . Try to do everything just wrong . Make sure you never talk about anything that is not small talk . Keep your coat on long after your host offers to take it and then just leave it on a couch somewhere . Insist you do not want anything to drink , only to decide you want something the moment your host takes their seat . Make sure you try to find the glass for your drink and then give up . If the food is cold by the time you are taken care of , you have done a good job .

Content:The best option is obviously a sleeveless suit , but if you cannot do that I would vote for the muscle shirt . If you are scrawny then it is a great choice and if you are quite well muscled then make sure you come straight from the gym to look as swol as possible .
