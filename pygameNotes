Installing PyGame

MAC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. install homebrew

1.1 xcode-select --install
1.2 ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
1.3 Go to this url

http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/installing-homebrew-os-x-yosemite-10-10-package-manager-unix-apps/

Download Xquartz from the link there, about halfway down the page

1.4 brew doctor

You'll get warnings - ignore them

2. Installing PyGame

2.1 brew install mercurial
2.2a brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf smpeg portmidi

This will probably give you an error "no formula found for smpeg"
If not, continue to 2.3

2.2b brew tap homebrew/headonly
2.2c brew install --HEAD smpeg
     
This will take a long time and install multiple things. You may
also get a timeout error. If you do, make sure you are not connected to MGuest.
MGuest will block the url you need to download from.

2.2d brew install sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi 

2.3 sudo pip install hg+http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame

3. Testing

3.1 open terminal
3.2 type 'python' without quotes
3.3 type 'import pygame' without quotes
3.4 if nothing happens, it worked!
    if it said something like "no module named pygame", then send me an email.

Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
You will need to go to the link below and choose the correct msi file.

http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

The exact file you need depends on which version of python you are running.
You can see it by starting up the python interpreter. It will print the
version number.
